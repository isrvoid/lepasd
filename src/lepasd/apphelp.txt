Type out passwords based on a single password, storage free.

Usage:
  Start the daemon:
  $ lepasd
  Assuming lepasd/tags has '@sometag', arm typing:
  $ lepasd sometag
  Within %d s select the password field and press %s to type out the password.

Files (tags, crc) are stored in '%s'

Choosing a password:
  A good password is strong and easy to remember: a made up sentence or combination of words.
  Recommended length is at least 12 characters. There is no strength check - choose wisely.

When new CRC is created:
  If the CRC seems unfamiliar, consider killing and restaring the daemon to verify the password.
  If it's wrong, remove '%s' and restart the daemon to retype.

'tags' options:
  A minimal tag in '%s' consists of a single name:
  @foo
  It's equivalent to explicitly stated default options (version, length, encoding):
  @foo v0 20 a
  To change a password, increment the version (e.g. 'v1').
  Encoding: a - alphanumeric; n - numeric; s - with special characters; r - with special characters restricted to %s
  Any line not beginning with '@' is a comment. It's useful for adding info below a tag (e.g. login name).
