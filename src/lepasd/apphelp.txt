Type out passwords based on a single password. Storageless - no vault.

Usage:
  Start the daemon:
  $ lepasd
  Assuming lepasd/tags has '@sometag', arm typing:
  $ lepasd sometag
  Within 10 s select the password field and press the configured key to type out the password.

Password output depends on the keyboard layout. Make sure English (US) is selected before firing.
Files (tags, crc) are stored in '%s'.

Configure trigger key:
  E.g. using 'xbindkeys', add 2 lines to '~/.xbindkeysrc':
"echo 1 > %s"
  Shift + Delete

'Can't emulate keyboard' exception:
  Typing is done via 'uinput' and requires write permission. If the exception occurs,
  copy the file from the repo's 'udev' directory to '/etc/udev/rules.d' and reboot.

Choosing a password:
  A good password is strong and easy to remember: a made up sentence or combination of words.
  Recommended length is at least 12 characters. There is no strength check - choose wisely.

When new CRC is created:
  If the CRC seems unfamiliar, consider killing and restaring the daemon to verify the password.
  If it's wrong, remove '%s' and restart the daemon to retype.

'tags' options:
  A minimal tag in '%s' consists of a single name:
  @foo
  It's equivalent to explicitly stated default options (version, length, encoding):
  @foo %s
  To change a password, increment the version (e.g. 'v1').
  Encoding: a - alphanumeric; n - numeric; r - requires variety; d - density
  Any line not beginning with '@' is a comment. It's useful for adding info below a tag (e.g. login name).
