Type out passwords based on a single password, storage free.

Usage:
  Start the daemon:
  $ napm
  Assuming napm/tags has '@sometag', arm typing:
  $ napm sometag
  Within %d s select the password field and press %s to type out the password.

Files (tags, crc) are stored in '%s'

Choosing a password:
  A good password is strong and easy to remember: a made up sentence or combination of words.
  Recommended length is at least 12 characters. There is no strength analysis - choose wisely. The length can't be 0.

When new CRC is created:
  If the CRC seems unfamiliar, consider killing and restaring the daemon to verify the password.
  If it's wrong, remove '%s' and restart the daemon to retype.
